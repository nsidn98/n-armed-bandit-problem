We are supposed to choose one option among n different options repeatedly
After each choice we recieve a numerical reward which depends on your selection.
Our objective is to maximize the total reward over some 1000 action selections
This is somewhat similiar to a slot machine which are found in casinos.Here each action is like playing
and each action is like pulling one of the levers.
In this problem each reward has an expected value reward.
One of the ways to tackle the problem is to choose the option having the highest reward in each action.
This method is called the Greedy Action Method.
But it may not always maximize our total reward.
Instead we could explore the tree and choose accordingly.
But we can't keep on exploring as we have to exploit the knowledge we have about the tree.
This is the conflict between 'exploring' and 'exploitation'
